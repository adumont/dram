# Drive a DRAM module with Arduino

In this project I'm driving an old 1MB DRAM SIMM memory module with an Arduino Uno board.

The module I use is a KMM591000BN-7 manufactured by Samsungs Electronics in 10/1994.

It consists of two KM44C1000BJ 1Mx4 modules, and one KM41C1000CJ 1Mx1, so it has a total capacity of 1M bit x 9: 1M x (8bits + 1 parity bit).

I have soldered a 30-pins male header so I can plug it on a breadboard.

## Circuit

### SIMM pins mapping to Arduino pins

We get the pins configuration of the SIMM module from the Datasheet. This is how I choose to map them to the Arduino board.

Due to the limited pin number of the Arduino Uno, I have used 4 bit of address bus (A0 to A3) and 4 bits of Data bus (DQ0 to DQ3):

### Circuit schematics

Shematics available as [Fritzing file](arduino/dram.fzz).

## Code

See this [first sketch](arduino/DIMM_KMM591000__3/DIMM_KMM591000__3.ino) that writes 0 to 15 (and reads the value) at address 0 to 15.

# Todo & next steps

- Implement different Row/Col addresses
- Implement Fast page writing/reading
- Use all address and data with, either:
  - serializing input/output with shift-registers (would reduce pins necesarry, but would slow the operation)
  - using an Arduino Mega (more GPIO pins)
- Write 
- Use Arduino [port registers manipulation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PortManipulation) to operate the DRAM
  - May need to reorganize the pins to put each DRAM bus on the same port register of the Arduino, to be able to assert all the pins of a same bus at the same time.
